		<p class="paragraph-3">You&#39;ve somehow found this site. I&#39;m thrilled to share my passion with you which is mainly learning about the stock market and real estate. With the projects above I can work towards my goal, which is buying my first rental property and gambling on the stock market like there&#39;s no tomorrow.</p>
		<p class="paragraph-3">I am merely joking. Trading is a serious business and should be treated like one. This site has been created to put my neck on the line by putting my strategies and journals online to further discipline myself. In the market, you don&#39;t have a boss or a mentor who watches your back - someone who tells you what not to do.</p>
		<p class="paragraph-3">This platform will help me get that impression by exposing myself to the public. It will aid me in taking my trading to the next level, just like <a class="linkage" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=john+bollinger" target="_blank">John Bollinger</a> did by giving his advice to me personally which you can find <a class="linkage" href="assets/audio.mp3" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

			<p class="paragraph-3">Even though I have a full-time job it doesn't mean I am sitting still. During my free time I educate myself to become a technical analyst (income generating) and a portfolio manager. In essence, my nightmare is volatility whilst I am also a slave towards it. It's contradicting, however, I am both a portfolio manager and a swing trader.<br><br></p>

			<br /> In my free time (when not doing stonks) I am a big nerd. I watch anime or play games. Other than that, I also like to read psychology and self-improvement books. My favourite books at the moment are 48 laws of power and think and grow rich as they changed my perspectives on many levels. My favourite anime is Steins;Gate and Clannad!</p>
